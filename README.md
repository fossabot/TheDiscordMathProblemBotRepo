# Help! This bot isn't working!

There is currently an issue with the nextcord.py library, which currently does NOT support slash commands natively (however, they are working on it :)) Therefore, I am still using discord_slash.py, which will not start even if i uninstall nextcord due to ImportErrors. As soon as the library supports slash commands or I can use discord_slash.py again, I will start the bot. :)
