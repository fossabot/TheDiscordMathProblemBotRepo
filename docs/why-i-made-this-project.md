# Hello Reader!

Hello! I'm a 13 year old who wanted to code a discord bot. 
I made a reminder bot (on replit), but I realized many other bots (giselle, dyno, and sesh, and others) made one.
I wanted to be unique, so I decided to make this bot. :)
Feel free to contribute to my project with issues/pull requests! :)
