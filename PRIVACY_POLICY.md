## DISCLAIMER 
<!please contribute>

THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT KNOWINGLY STORE COPYRIGHTED PROBLEMS OR PROBLEMS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE BOT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL AND LICENSING! 

To the maximum extent of applicable law, I am not liable for any problems or quizzes or quiz-related material submitted (unless the author of the problem, as shown by the application, is me) through this application. 

I am also not liable to you if my bot shuts down or turns off to the maximum extent of applicable law.

## Why we store your data

Storing data you voluntarily submit to the bot, and data obtained via the Discord API, is required for the core functionality of the bot.

## Which data I store through this application

Data I store through this application include data from the Discord API, problems submitted, quizzes submitted, quiz problems submitted, deletion votes to problems, quiz submissions submitted. We may also store quiz gradings (and comments). 

## Disclosure of your data.

Problems or quizzes will be disclosed to people who want to view your problems, and are in the same guild as the problem, or if the problem is a global problem and the user uses the bot. Therefore, when you submit a problem, quiz, submission, or grade, you give us a license that is worldwide, non-revokeable except via deletion of the data you store, royalty-free, but does not transfer ownership of the problem to us. You are still attributed when you create a problem.

## Deleting your data I store

As of right now, quizzes do not have a user interface, so they cannot be deleted. Problems you submit can be deleted via /delete_problem. Due to Discord limitations, you are not able to delete problems that are part of Discord servers are not a part of. There are plans to implement a /delete_all_my_data command, which will delete all your problems, quizzes, quiz submissions, and grades you submitted.

## Extra things you need to know

Because this bot is open source, extra data may be collected about you that is not explicitly mentioned in this policy may be stored about you. However, this does summarize most of the data we store about you.

## Updates

This policy may be updated at any time. Because this application do not store email information or Discord username/discriminator combinations with the intent of contacting you if policy updates occur, we cannot, and will not, contact you about changes to this policy. 

# One final thing

When you use this application, you agree to these policies. If you do not agree to these policies, do not use this application.

Contributions to this application must follow the GPL v3 license. I greatly appreciate any and all contributions you make!
